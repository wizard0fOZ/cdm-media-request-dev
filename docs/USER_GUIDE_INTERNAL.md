# Internal User Guide — CDM Media Request System

Purpose
-------
This guide helps non-technical internal team members use the CDM Media Request system: how requests are submitted, how to use the admin panel, and common tasks you will perform.

Who this is for
----------------
- Coordinators, approvers, schedulers, and content editors who will interact with requests via the admin panel.
- No technical background required.

Quick overview
--------------
- Requesters use a public form to submit media requests (the front-end public site).
- Internal staff use the Admin Panel to view, approve/reject, assign staff, add notes, and schedule resources.

Logging in (Admin)
-------------------
1. Go to the Admin login page (your usual internal Admin URL).
2. Enter your work username and password.
3. If you forget your password, contact the system admin or the support contact listed at the end of this guide.

Dashboard: Main areas
---------------------
- Pending Requests: Requests waiting for review/approval.
- Calendar: Visual schedule of approved/reserved events and bookings.
- Content: Manage content related to a request (if applicable).
- Settings: Manage users, rooms/equipment, and system preferences (only for users with appropriate permissions).

How to process a request (step-by-step)
---------------------------------------
1. Open the Admin Panel and go to Pending Requests.
2. Click a request to open the Request Details page.
3. Review the request information: requester contact, date/time, rooms/equipment needed, content details, and any attachments.
4. If more information is needed, click Request Info (or the equivalent) and leave a note describing exactly what you need.
5. To approve a request: click Approve → confirm any per-service options as prompted → choose any notifications or next steps.
6. To reject a request: click Reject → choose a reason from the list or enter a short explanation → submit. The requester will receive the rejection email.
7. To assign responsibilities: use Assign Coordinator or Assign PIC to select the staff member responsible for follow-up.
8. Add an internal Note if you need to log a decision, clarification, or instruction for other staff.

Common Admin Actions (plain language)
-------------------------------------
- Approve: Mark the request accepted and (optionally) reserve resources.
- Reject: Decline the request and inform the requester why.
- Request Info: Ask the requester for missing or unclear details.
- Assign Coordinator / PIC: Give ownership of the request to a specific staff member.
- Add Note: Internal comment only—does not notify the requester unless you choose to.
- Save Content / Equipment / Room: Record or update details that will be used for the request.

Calendar and scheduling
-----------------------
- Use the Calendar view to see bookings by date.
- When approving a request that needs a room or equipment, confirm availability on the calendar first.
- If there's a scheduling conflict, either reschedule the request (ask requester) or reject with an explanation.

Handling attachments and media
------------------------------
- Attachments uploaded with a request (audio, video, documents) appear on the Request Details page.
- Download attachments to review them. If files are too large or corrupted, contact IT/support.

Notifications and emails
------------------------
- The system sends automated emails at key events: submission confirmation, approval, rejection, and requests for more info.
- If a requester doesn't receive an email, confirm their email address in the request and check spam folders.

Tips for clear communication
----------------------------
- When asking for more info, be specific about what you need and provide a deadline.
- Use the internal Notes field for context that other team members need to see.
- If you make a decision that affects scheduling, update the calendar and add a note explaining why.

Simple examples
---------------
- Example: Approving a request
  1. Open request → verify date & resources → check calendar availability → click Approve → add note "Confirmed equipment and room".

- Example: Asking for more info
  1. Open request → click Request Info → enter: "Please confirm whether you'll need live-streaming; also confirm speaker arrival time." → Send.

FAQ (short)
-----------
Q: Who can approve requests?
A: Users with Approver permissions listed in the Admin's Users or Settings area. If you need permissions, ask your manager or system admin.

Q: What if the requested room is already booked?
A: Check the calendar; if booked, contact the requester to reschedule or choose an alternative room.

Q: How do I change a request after approval?
A: Open the request, add a Note describing the change, and depending on the change, update booking details or contact the requester to confirm changes.

Troubleshooting (common non-technical issues)
-------------------------------------------
- Can't log in: check username/password; if still failing, contact the system admin.
- Missing attachments/invalid files: ask the requester to re-upload or send files via email and add to the request.
- Email not sent/received: check the requester's email for typos; ask support to check system email delivery if many failures occur.

Security & data handling
------------------------
- Only share request details with necessary staff.
- Do not download or store sensitive attachments locally beyond immediate use.
